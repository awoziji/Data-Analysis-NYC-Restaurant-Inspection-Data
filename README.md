<h1> Data Analytics </h1>
<h3> A COOL project I have done with 2 other people at Dec 2017. </h3>
<p>data sources: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j; and Yelp/Geocode data through API</p>
<p>The main topic is whether there is strong relationship between the level of clealiness and popular degree(score at Yelp). - The answer is No! There are basic stats based analysis as well as machine learning based analysis in this project.</p>
